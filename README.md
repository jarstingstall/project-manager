project-manager
===============

A project manager to manage clients, projects, tasks, invoicing, and time-tracking. This is my first stab at a fully functioning Laravel 4 app. 

Todos:

1. Clean up Blade templates
2. Clean up Model/Table relationships (Many to Many Relationships and Pivot Tables)
3. Set up Invoice Email template (Get all necessary data to view)
4. Put Controllers on a diet (Move logic to external classes, repositories, models, etc...)
5. Set up Client Log In
